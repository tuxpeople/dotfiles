# Thomas’s dotfiles

With many thanks to [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don't want or need. Don't blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

### Manual Installation

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/git/dotfiles`, with `~/dotfiles` as a symlink.)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/git
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/tuxpeople/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

Then manually symlink or copy the files you need to your home directory. For example:

```bash
ln -s ~/git/dotfiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
ln -s ~/git/dotfiles/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
ln -s ~/git/dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
# ... and so on for other files you want to use
```

### Automated Installation with Ansible

For automated deployment, I use Ansible with the [geerlingguy.dotfiles](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-dotfiles) role. This is my preferred method for setting up new machines.

### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/tuxpeople/dotfiles/blob/aff769fd75225d8f2e481185a71d5e05b76002dc/.aliases#L21-26)) takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# Git credentials
# Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Thomas Deutsch"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="thomas@mail.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions and aliases from my dotfiles repository. It’s probably better to [fork this repository](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/fork) instead, though.

### Sensible macOS defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults:

```bash
~/.macos
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and your preferred formulae. Some functionality in these dotfiles depends on certain packages being installed:

- **Git completion**: These dotfiles use the Homebrew version of Git with enhanced completion
- **direnv**: For directory-based environment variables (see `.bash_profile:89`)
- **mise**: Modern replacement for asdf version manager (see `.bash_profile:93`)
- **pyenv**: Python version management (see `.bash_profile:97`)
